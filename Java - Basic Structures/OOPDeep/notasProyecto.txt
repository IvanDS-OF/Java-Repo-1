UML
Unifies Modeling Languaje







//NOTES ABOUT OBJECTS
The first we must do is analyze this text and recognize the sustantives and the Verbsshown in the same one
The *Sustantives could be or not out future **CLASES and their **ATRIBUTES. Mieanwhile the verbs could be or not
out future **METHODS



HOw to mane the Packages? 
We should start with the Domain of out enterprise but in its inverse way
Essempio: 
Domain - MyEnt.com 
Package name - com.MyEnt



//Interfaces
When creating an Interface in Java, this one is completely abstraction
But there are some times that we dont know how to fill the information of our Interface when we are
creating a new class. We can solve this issua by using Abstract Interfaces. 
That creates the body of the known things and the unknown things can wait.
